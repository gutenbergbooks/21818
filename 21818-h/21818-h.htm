<h2>THE LAST WOMAN.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A contemporary Pendant to "The Last Man."</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>All modish shapes must melt in gloom,</p>
<p class="i2">Great <span class="sc">Worth</span> himself must die,</p>
<p>Before the Sex again assume</p>
<p class="i2"><span class="sc">Eve's</span> sweet simplicity!</p>
<p>I saw a vision in my sleep,</p>
<p>Which made me bow my head and weep</p>
<p class="i2">As one aghast, accurst!</p>
<p>Was it a spook before me past?</p>
<p>Of women I beheld the last,</p>
<p class="i2">As <span class="sc">Adam</span> saw the first.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Regent Street seemed "No Thoroughfare,"</p>
<p class="i2">Bond Street looked weird, inhuman;</p>
<p>The spectres of past fashions were</p>
<p class="i2">Around that lonely Woman.</p>
<p>Some were the work of native hands,</p>
<p>Some had arrived from foreign lands,</p>
<p class="i2">Nondescript jumbles some!</p>
<p>Pall-Mall had now nor sound nor tread,</p>
<p>Park Lane was silent as the dead,</p>
<p class="i2">Belgravia was dumb.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Yet, lighthouse-like, that lone one stood,</p>
<p class="i2">Or whisked her skirts around,</p>
<p>Like a wild wind that sweeps the wood,</p>
<p class="i2">And strews with leaves the ground.</p>
<p>Singing, "Our hour is come, O Sun</p>
<p>Of Fashion! We'll have no more fun.</p>
<p class="i2">Solitude is <i>too</i> slow!</p>
<p>True thou hast worn ten thousand shapes</p>

<p>To dress&mdash;when not another She</p>

<p class="i2">No, it won't pay at all!</p>

<p>Nothing they did that's worth recall,</p>

<p>Man always <i>was</i> a noisy quack</p>
<p class="i2">Who thought himself a god;</p>

<p>(If he <i>could</i> kick) at&mdash;CRINOLINE.</p>
<p class="i2">Were he recalled to breath,</p>
<p>I'll have one last man-mocking spree</p>
<p>By <i>donning hooped skirts</i>. Victory!</p>
<p class="i2"><i>This</i> takes all sting from Death!</p>

<p>The darkening universe defy,</p>

<h2>A PLAINT FROM PARNASSUS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By an "Unrecommended" Resident.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>[Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> (replying to Mr. <span class="sc">Johnston</span>, of Ballykilbeg) announced that no recommendation
had been submitted to Her <span class="sc">Majesty</span> upon
the subject of the succession to the office of Poet
Laureate, and that there was no immediate
intention of submitting one.]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Glorious Apollo! This is wondrous hard!</p>
<p>Fancy <span class="sc">John Bull</span> without Official Bard!</p>
<p>His plight is sad as that of the great men</p>
<p>Who lived, unmarked by the Poetic Pen,</p>
<p>Before great <span class="sc">Agamemnon</span>. Ah, my <span class="sc">Horace</span>,</p>
<p>Britons are a Boeotian, heavy, slow race!</p>
<p>As for the "Statesman" who treats bards so shabbily,</p>
<p>'Twill serve him right if thine "<i>illacrimabile</i>"</p>
<p>Applies to him. A Premier, but no Poet?</p>
<p>England, you are dishonoured, and don't know it.</p>
<p>Void of a <i>Sacer Vates</i> to enshrine</p>
<p>In gorgeous trope and long-resounding line,</p>
<p>Thy Victories, and Weddings, Shows and Valour?</p>
<p>Parnassus shakes, the Muses pine in pallor.</p>
<p>When foreign princelings mate our sweet princesses,</p>
<p>When Rads of fleets and armies made sad messes,</p>
<p>And stand in need of verbal calcitration;</p>
<p>When&mdash;let's say <span class="sc">Ashmead-Bartlett</span>&mdash;saves the nation</p>
<p>In the great name of glorious Saint Jingo;</p>
<p>When <span class="sc">Bull</span> gives toko or delivers stingo.</p>
<p>To Fuzzy-Wuzzy, or such foolish savages;</p>
<p>When our great guns commit most gallant ravages</p>
<p>Among the huts of some unhappy village,</p>
<p>Where naughty "niggers" have gone in for pillage;</p>
<p>When <span class="sc">Someone</span> condescends to be high-born,</p>
<p>Or deigns to die, who now shall toot the horn,</p>
<p>Or twang the lyre, emitting verse divine,</p>
<p>For Fame and&mdash;say, about a pound per line?</p>
<p>I must submit. I have not been "submitted,"</p>
<p>But poetless <span class="sc">John Bull</span> is to be pitied.</p>
<p>Of course self-praise is no "recommendation,"</p>
<p>(In <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> sense) or else, unhappy nation,</p>
<p>I, even I, could spare you natural worry at,</p>
<p>Your non-possession of a Poet-Laureate!</p>
</div></div>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">In a Pickwickian Sense</span>.&mdash;When "a nate
Irishman" (as the song has it) "meets with a
friend," he incontinently "for love knocks
him down," whether with a "sprig of shillelagh"
or a "flower of speech," depends
upon circumstances. In either case he
"means no harm," or at any rate far less
harm than the phlegmatic and matter-of-fact
Saxon is apt to fancy. Probably, therefore,
an "Irish Phrase Book," giving the real
"meaning" of Hibernian rhetorical epithets,
would prove a great peacemaker, in Parliament
and out. Colonel <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, when
he had recovered his temper, and with it his
wit, "toned down" the provocative "murderous
ruffian," into the inoffensive "excited
politician." But what a pity it is that "excited
politicians" so often string themselves up to
(verbal) "ruffianism."</p>

</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>And though I lay aside my weeds,</p>
<p class="i2">Yet like a widow I bemoan;</p>
<p class="i2">Nor all the wealth the Indies own,</p>
<p>Could satisfy my present needs.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Thy spark has vanished from my sight,</p>

<h2>A METROPOLITAN MAYOR'S NEST.</h2>

<blockquote><p>["The Common Council is stated to have appointed a 'Fighting Committee'
to oppose the Unification of London, and to take steps for the formation of
separate Municipalities in different parts of the Metropolis."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Mayor's Day.</i>&mdash;Ah, if only we had not got Parliament to
sanction the plan of splitting London up into distinct Municipalities,
what a proud day this would be for me! As it is, must try and
remember that I am <i>not</i> <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> of London at all, but only
Mayor of the new Corporate Borough of Cripplegate Without, one of
the half-dozen boroughs into which the old City has been divided.</p>

<p><i>The Show.</i>&mdash;Well, thank goodness, we do keep <i>that</i> up! All
the 674 Mayors of all the different districts of London take part in
it. That reminds me that I must put on my Civic robes, edged
with imitation ermine, and my aluminium chain of office, and prepare
to start. A little hitch to begin with. Mayors all assembled outside
Guildhall. Mayor of South-South-West Hammersmith tries to join
us. Nobody seems to know him. Very suspicious, especially as, on
referring to official records, we find that there is no such borough as
South-South-West Hammersmith! We tell him so. He replies,
sulkily, that it was created last night by a Special Vote of the
South-West Hammersmith Town Council, who found the work
getting too much for them, and that, anyhow, "he intends to take
part in the procession." Awkward&mdash;but we have to yield.</p>

<p><i>In the Streets.</i>&mdash;The 675 Mayors don't inspire as much respect as I
should like. Perhaps it is due to the fact that a regular scramble
took place for seats in the old <span class="sc">Lord Mayor's</span> Coach, in the course of
which the Mayor of Tottenham Court Road was badly pommeled
by the Mayor of Battersea Rise, and the coach itself had one side
knocked out of it. Also that we other Mayors have to follow on foot,
and are repeatedly asked if we are a procession of the Unemployed!</p>

<p><i>At the Law Courts.</i>&mdash;In the good old days Lord Chief Justice
used to deliver a flowery harangue congratulating the Chief Magistrate
on his elevation. But who <i>is</i> the Chief Magistrate now?
To-day a free fight among the Mayors to get first into the Court.
In consequence, Chief Justice angrily orders Court to be cleared,
and threatens to commit us for contempt! Yet surely in former
days a Judge would have been imprisoned in the deepest dungeons
of the Mansion House for much less.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;The hospitable custom of the Ministerial banquet still
retained. Prime Minister adopts tactics of the Music Hall "Lion
Comique," and, after addressing a few genial words to the guests
assembled at the table of the Mayor of West Ham, jumps into
brougham, and appears a few minutes later at Mayor of Shadwell's
banquet, and so on to Poplar and Whitechapel, and as many
as he can crowd in. Other Ministers do the same. Still, not
enough Cabinet Councillors to go round, and to-night I am horrified
to find that the assistant Under-Secretary to the deputy Labour
Commissioner had been chosen to reply to the toast of the health of
the Ministry at <i>my</i> banquet! Ichabod, indeed! [By the way,
what a good name for a new Lord Mayor, "Ichabod," say, if knighted,
"Sir <span class="sc">Thomas Ichabod</span>." Air to be played by band on his entering
Guildhall, "Ichabody meet a body." But alas! these are dreams!
Ichabod!] Yet, as the only building in which the Mayor of Cripplegate
Without can entertain his guest is the fourth floor of an unused
warehouse, perhaps we really don't deserve a higher official. Still,
one can't help regretting that the City, in its natural dread of the
so-called "Unification of London," persuaded the Government to
agree to this sort of "Punification of London."</p>

<h2>THE MAN FROM BLANKLEY'S.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Story in Scenes.</span></p>

with opal-tinted globes; two cast-iron Cavaliers holding
gas-lamps on the mantel-piece. Oil-portrait, enlarged from

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Deuced quaint-looking people&mdash;wish
they wouldn't all eat their soup at me! Why can't somebody say
something? Wonder who's the Lady in black, all over big silver
tears&mdash;like a foreign funeral. Don't feel equal to talking to
<span class="sc">Marjory</span> again till I've had some Sherry. (<i>After sipping it.</i>) Wormwood,
by Jove! Champagne will probably be syrup&mdash;touch old
<span class="sc">Gilwattle</span> up if he isn't careful&mdash;ah, <i>he</i> jibs at the Sherry!</p>

of <span class="sc">Gwennie's</span> Quinine
Wine had got
down into the cellar

Don't drink it,

Sherry, my Lord?
Don't you find it

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>observing

Oh, excellent,
Sir&mdash;very&mdash;er&mdash;mellow
and agreeable!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Ha&mdash;yes&mdash;now
your Lordship
mentions it,
there's a sort of
nuttiness about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He empties his

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to

<i>rotten</i>-nuttiness!
I'm hanged if he
hasn't bolted it!
Wonderful old
Johnny!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to him,
in an under-tone</i>).
You said <i>quite</i> the
right thing!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>ambiguously</i>). Oh, not at all!</p>

<p><i>Conversational Scraps.</i> Assure you if I touch the smallest particle
of lobster it instantly flies to my.... Yes, <i>alive</i>. A dear friend of
mine positively had to leave her lodgings at the seaside&mdash;she was so
disturbed by the screams of the lobsters being boiled in the back-kitchen....
I was reading only the other day that oysters' hearts
continue to beat down to the very moment they are being assimilated....

that they should only be eaten under chloroform, or something?...
I <i>never</i> get tired of turbot&mdash;cod, now, I <i>don't</i> care for, and salmon

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> (<i>to herself.</i>) To see <span class="sc">Douglas</span> here a&mdash;a <i>paid parasite</i>&mdash;and
actually seeming to <i>enjoy</i> his food&mdash;it's like some dreadful
nightmare&mdash;I <i>can't</i> believe it! But I'm glad he hasn't the face to
speak to me!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Seakale</span> <i>offering Hock.</i>) If you please. (<i>To himself,
after tasting.</i>) Why, it's quite decent! I begin to feel up to
having this out with <span class="sc">Marjory</span>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, isn't it
rather ridiculous for two such old friends as we are to sit through
dinner in deadly silence? Can't you bring yourself to talk to me?
we shan't be overheard. You might tell me <i>why</i> you think me such
a ruffian&mdash;it would start us, at any rate!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> I don't <i>want</i> to be started&mdash;and if you really don't
know why I hate your coming here in this way, Lord <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span>,
it's useless to explain!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Oh, we got as far as that upstairs, didn't we? And
I may be very dense, but for the life of me I can't see yet why I
shouldn't have come! Of course, I didn't know I was in for <i>this</i>
exactly, but, to tell you the truth, I'm by way of being here on
business, and I didn't care much whether they were cheery or not, so
long as I got what I <i>came</i> for, don't you know!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> Of course, that is the main thing in your eyes&mdash;but
I didn't think you would confess it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Why, you know how keen I used to be about my
Egyptian work&mdash;you remember the book on Hieroglyphs I always
meant to write? I'm getting on with it, though of course my time's
a good deal taken
up just now. And,
whether I get anything
out of these
people or not, I've
met <i>you</i> again,
<span class="sc">Marjory</span>&mdash;I don't
mind anything
else!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i>
Don't remind me of&mdash;of
what you used
to be, and&mdash;and you
are not to call me
<span class="sc">Marjory</span> any more.
We have met&mdash;and
I only hope and
pray we may never
meet again. Please
don't talk any more!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to
himself.</i>) That's a
facer! I wonder if
<span class="sc">Marjory's</span> quite&mdash;is
this the effect of
that infernal influenza?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to him
in an under-tone</i>).
You and Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>
appear to be on
very familiar terms.
I really feel it my
duty to ask you
when and how you
made the acquaintance
of my daughter's
governess.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to
himself</i>). The governess!
That explains
a lot. Poor
little <span class="sc">Marjory</span>!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Really?
I congratulate you.
I had the honour of
knowing Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>
in Scotland a
year or two ago, and this is the first time we have met since.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Indeed? That is <i>so far</i> satisfactory. I hope you will
understand that, so long as Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> is in my employment, I
cannot allow her to&mdash;er&mdash;continue your acquaintanceship&mdash;it is not
as if you were in a position&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>with suppressed wrath.</i>) Forgive me&mdash;but, as Miss
<span class="sc">Seaton</span> shows no desire whatever to renew my acquaintance, I don't
see that we need discuss my position, or hers either. And I must
decline to do so.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>crimsoning.</i>) Oh, very <i>well</i>. I am not accustomed to
be told what subjects I am to discuss at my own table, but (<i>scathingly</i>)
no doubt your <i>position here</i> gives you the right to be independent&mdash;ahoo!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I venture to think so. (<i>To himself.</i>) Can't make
this woman out&mdash;is she trying to be rude, or what?</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Hullo, your Lordship's got no Champagne! How's
that? It's all <i>right</i>&mdash;"<span class="sc">Fizzler</span>, '84," my Lord!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I daresay&mdash;but the fact is, I am strictly forbidden
to touch it.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span><p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Pooh!&mdash;if your Lordship will excuse the remark&mdash;<i>this</i>
won't do you any harm&mdash;comes out of my own cellar, so I <i>ought</i> to
know. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Seakale</span>.) Here, you, fill his Lordship's glass, d'ye
hear?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>in a rapid whisper.</i>) Don't make a fuss&mdash;you can take
<i>one</i> glass as he wishes it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) Can I though? If she imagines I'm
going to poison myself to please her uncle! (<span class="sc">Seakale</span> <i>gives him half
a glass, after receiving a signal from</i> Mrs. T.) I suppose I must
just&mdash;&mdash;(<i>After tasting.</i>) Why it's <i>dry</i>! Then why the deuce
was I cautioned not to&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> That's a fine wine, isn't it, my Lord? Not much of
<i>that</i> in the market nowadays, I can tell you!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) Precious little <i>here</i>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) So I
should imagine, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Your Lordship mustn't pass this <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. My niece's
cook knows her business, I will say that for her.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>as he helps himself.</i>) I have already discovered that
she is an artist.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>in displeased surprise.</i>) Then you know my cook <i>too</i>?
An <i>artist</i>? and she seems such a <i>respectable</i> person! Pray what
sort of pictures does she paint?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Pictures? Oh, really I don't know&mdash;potboilers
probably.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Mrs. <span class="sc">Tid.</span> <i>glares at him suspiciously</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Conversational Scraps.</i> And when I got into the hall and saw
them all sitting in a row with their faces blacked, I said "I'm sure
<i>they</i> can't be the Young Men's Christian Association!"...
Hysteria? my poor dear wife is a dreadful sufferer from it&mdash;I've
known her unable to sleep at all except with one foot curled round
her neck!... (&amp;c. &amp;c.)</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>) There's no doubt about it&mdash;this woman
<i>is</i> trying to snub me&mdash;hardly brings herself to talk at all&mdash;and <i>then</i>
she's beastly rude! What did she ask me here <i>for</i> if she can't be
civil! If she wasn't my hostess&mdash;I'll try her once more, she may
know something about antiquities&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) I suppose Mr. <span class="sc">Cartouche</span>
keeps his collection in a separate room? I was told he has
some hunting scarabs of the Amenhoteps that I am very curious to
see.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). Mr. <span class="sc">Cartouche</span> may keep all sorts of disagreeable
pets, for anything <i>I</i> know to the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself, in amazement</i>). Pets! I'm hanged if
I let myself be snubbed like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I'm afraid you have
very little sympathy with his tastes?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Sympathy, indeed! I don't even know if he <i>has</i> any
tastes. I am not in the habit of troubling myself about my next-door
neighbour's affairs.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>with a gasp</i>). Your next-door&mdash;&mdash;! (<i>He pulls
himself together.</i>) To be sure&mdash;of course not&mdash;stupid of me to ask!
(<i>To himself.</i>) Good Heavens!&mdash;these <i>aren't</i> the <span class="sc">Cartouches</span>! I'm
<i>at the wrong dinner-party</i>&mdash;and this awful woman thinks I've done
it on purpose! No wonder she's so confoundedly uncivil!...
And <span class="sc">Marjory</span> knows it, too, and won't speak to me! Perhaps they
<i>all</i> know it.... What on earth am I to do?... I feel such a fool!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>to herself</i>). How perfectly <i>ghastly</i> <span class="sc">Douglas</span> is
looking! Didn't he <i>really</i> know the <span class="sc">Cartouches</span> lived next door?...
Then&mdash;<i>oh</i>, what an idiot I've been! It's a mistake&mdash;he <i>doesn't</i>
come from <span class="sc">Blankley's</span> at all! I <i>must</i> speak to him&mdash;I must tell
him how&mdash;&mdash;no, I <i>can't</i>&mdash;I forgot how horrid I've been to him!
I should have to tell him I believed <i>that</i>&mdash;and I'd rather die! No,
it's too late&mdash;it's too late now!</p>

<h2>DRAMATIC WITHOUT BEING STAGEY.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/065.png"><img width="100%" src="images/065.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>The plan, successfully inaugurated, and, within the last fortnight,
still more successfully carried out by Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus Operaticus
Balmascus Pantomimicus</span>, of giving what may be called "unstagey
representations" of popular Operas&mdash;that is, popular Operas sung
and acted without the aid of scenes or properties (though "substitutes"
may be permitted, as, for example, a chair with four legs
complete would
represent a horse,
and a round table
a tower); the
singers, however,
being in costume,
may work an extensive
"Transformation"
Scene
(which is quite
in Sir <span class="sc">Drurio's</span>
line) in the
Dramatic and Operatic world, and
may effect such a change as will save
thousands to a Manager. Why not
go a step further? Why have "costumes,"
or even "hand-properties"? Why not leave everything,
except the perfection of the singing and the dramatic action, to
the imagination of the audience? The prices of admission would
be proportionately lowered, and the numbers admitted, in all probability,
would be trebled, on which hypothesis a calculation may
be based. What an exercise it would be for the imagination of the
audience, were the Statue Scene from <i>Don Giovanni</i> to be given
with the Basso Profondo in evening dress, who represents the Stony
Commendatore, seated astride a plank resting on tressels placed on a
table which would have been substituted for the stone pedestal,
while the Don or <i>Leporello</i> (it doesn't much matter which) sings his
asides to the audience! Here is novelty, and a great attraction!
It is returning to Elizabethan days, when Managers called a spade
a spade, and then so labelled it to prevent mistakes.</p>

<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<p class="center">HOSTS.</p>

<p>"Dear Punch," writes a valued Correspondent, "I wish you'd
tip me the wink how I'm to talk to my hosts. I'm a poor man, but
not a poor shot. So I get asked about a good deal to different
places, and as I'm not the sort that turns on the talking-tap very
easily, I often get stuck up. Just as I've got fairly into the swim
with one of them I leave him, and have to think of talk for quite a
different kind of chap, and so on all through the season. For
instance, last December I did three shoots in as many weeks. The
first was with old <span class="sc">Callaby</span>, the rich manufacturer, who's turned
sportsman late in life. I thought he'd like a talk about bimetallism,
so I sweated it up a bit, and started off with a burst as soon as I got
a look in. All no go. Nothing would please him but to talk of
birds, and rabbits, and hares, and farming, and crops, and who was
going to be High Sheriff, and all that. So I got a little left at the
first go off.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/069.png"><img width="100%" src="images/069.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>"Next week I shot with <span class="sc">Blossom</span>, another new friend, who's
come into money lately, after knocking about all over America the
greater part of his life.
I tried him with the
Chicago Exposition,
and ranching as a business
for younger sons;
did it delicately, of
course, and with any
amount of deference,
but he only looked at
me blankly, and began
talking about the Bank-rate.
After that, I
settled with myself I
wouldn't talk to any
more of them about
things that they might
be expected to feel an
interest in.</p>

<p>"In the following
week I was due at
<span class="sc">Whichello's</span>. He's
been a perfect lunatic
all his life for music.
He got up an orchestra
in his nursery, which
came to smash because
his younger brother
filled all the wind instruments
with soap-suds.
Later on he was
always scraping, or
blowing, or thumping,
scooting about from
one concert to another,
making expeditions to
the shrine of <span class="sc">Wagner</span>
as he called it, composing
songs, and symphonies,
and operas, and
Heaven only knows
what besides. He came
into the old place in
Essex when his brother died, about a year ago, and this was his
first pheasant-shoot. I thought to myself, 'If you're anything
like these other Johnnies, it's no good pulling out the music-stop
with you.' On the first morning he seemed a shade anxious at
breakfast, and said he was going to try a new plan of beating his
coverts, which it had given him a lot of trouble to arrange as he
wanted. Off we went after breakfast. We had about half a mile
to walk before we got to the first wood, and I kept puzzling my
brains the whole way about this blessed new dodge of beating.</p>

<p>"'Where are the beaters?' I said to <span class="sc">Whichello</span>, when we
got there, for devil a bit of one did I see.</p>

<p>"'You'll find them out directly,' says <span class="sc">Whichello</span>, looking sly
and triumphant; 'just you stand here, and wait. You'll get some
shooting, I warrant you;' and, with that, he posted the other
guns at the far end of the covert, told me and another chap we
were to walk outside, in line with the beaters, and walked off.
Suddenly he gave a whistle. Then what do you think happened?
I'll give you a hundred guesses, and you won't be on it. Out of
a little planting, about fifty yards off the piece we were to shoot,
came marching a troop of rustics, dressed as rustic beaters usually
are, but each of them carrying, in place of the ordinary beater's
stick, a musical instrument of some sort. They were headed by
the keeper, who waved a kind of <i>b&acirc;ton</i>. When they got to our
covert, they arranged themselves in line, and then, on a signal from
<span class="sc">Whichello</span>, crash, bang! they struck up the <i>Tannh&auml;user March</i>,
and disappeared into the wood.</p>

<p>"'Line up, Trombone!' shouted the keeper&mdash;I heard his
stentorian roar above the din&mdash;'Come, hurry along with the
Bombardon; Ophicleide, you're too far in front. Keep it going,
Clarinets. Now then, all together! What are you up to, Cymbals?
Let 'em have it!' And thus they came banging and booming
and blowing through the covert. The bassoon tripped into a thorn-bush,
the big-drum rolled over the trunk of a tree and smashed his
instrument, the hautboy threw his at an escaping rabbit, while
the flute-man walked straight into a pool of water, and had to be
pulled out by the triangle. But the rest of them got through somehow
with that infernal idiot of a conducting keeper, still backing
and twisting and waving like mad in the front. That was
<span class="sc">Whichello's</span> idea of beating his coverts. 'Combining &aelig;sthetic
pleasure with sporting pursuits,' he called it. Somehow we had
managed to bring down a brace of pheasants, which, with three
rabbits, made up our total, out of a covert which ought to have
yielded ten times as many.</p>

<p>"I daresay you won't believe this story, but it's true all the same.
If you don't believe it,
write to <span class="sc">Whichello</span>
himself. I never saw
anyone half so pleased
as that fool was. He
had given up all his
time to teaching his
rustics music, with a
view to this performance,
and had shoved in,
as one of his keepers,
a sporting third violin
from the Drury Lane
orchestra. They said
it was glorious, and
congratulated one another
all round, with as
much enthusiasm as if
they'd repelled a
foreign invasion. On
the next beat they
played the <i>March in
Scipio</i>, and after that
came a <i>Pot-Pourri of
Popular Melodies</i>, arranged
by the keeper.
They played a selection
from <i>The Pirates of
Penzance</i> while we
lunched, and took the
big wood to the tunes
of '<i>Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i>'
and '<i>Up-rouse
ye then, my
merry, merry Men!</i>'
'<i>Rule Britannia</i>' and
'<i>Home, Sweet Home</i>,'
played us back to the
house. I never heard
such a confounded Babel
of brass and wood in
all my life. A German
band in a country town couldn't come near it. Curiously enough, we
most of us got urgent letters by next morning's post, summoning us
home at once to attend to business, or to be present at the death-beds
of relatives. I thought you'd like to hear this story, old cock.
If you like, you're very welcome to shove it in your shooting series.
I've seen a lot of rum goes in my life, but this was the rummest of
the lot. And don't forget to let me have a word or two about talking
to one's host. I know what I thought of that maniac <span class="sc">Whichello</span>,
but I shouldn't have liked to say that to him.</p>

<p class="center">"Yours to a turn,<br />
<span class="sc">A Sportsman</span>."</p>

<p>For the present I must leave this striking letter to the judgment
of my readers. Space fails me to deal with it adequately. On
another occasion I may be able to set down some ideas on the
difficult subject suggested by my polite Correspondent.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">The Appreciation of Gold.</span>&mdash;"Why all this fuss?" writes a
Correspondent. "Is there a difficulty in finding persons who
properly appreciate gold? If so, I, Sir, am not of that number. I
will be happy to receive from the Bank any quantity of sovereigns;
and, further, I will undertake to show and honestly express my
appreciation of this generosity on the part of the Bank. Ah! I
should like to possess any number of those 'promises of May.'</p>

<p class="center">"Yours,<br />

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, Jan. 31st.</i>&mdash;"Members desiring to
take their seats will please come to the Table."</p>

<p>'Twas the voice of the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>; one could hear him declaim just
as Big Ben tolled four o'clock this afternoon. House crowded in
every part, throbbing with excitement; crowds everywhere. In
Centre Hall some vainly hoping for impossible places; others content
to see the men go by whose names they read in the papers. Outside
Palace Yard multitude standing patiently for hours, happy if only
they saw the tip of Mr. G.'s hat as he drove in at the gate, or
imagined the buttons on the Squire of <span class="sc">Malwood's</span> gaiters. Never,
in recent times, such a rush on opening days.</p>

<p>And Colonel <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, comfortably seated on Front Bench
below Gangway, in choice companionship with Dr. <span class="sc">Tanner</span>, actually
yawning!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:65%;"><a href="images/070.png"><img width="100%" src="images/070.png" alt="Historical Subject" /></a><p class="center"><span class="sc">Historical Subject</span>.&mdash;S-nd-rs-n "finding the body of"&mdash;T-nn-r.</p></div>

<p>"All very well for you, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, dear boy," he said, responsive to
my polite stare. "You come down here leisurely in afternoon, and
take your seat. I've been on war-path since before daybreak.
Knew the wild Irishmen meant to open proceedings of Session by
appropriating our seats. Have not served in Royal Irish Fusiliers
for nothing. Session opened by Royal Commission at two o'clock
this afternoon. Thought if I arrived on spot at seven in morning
would be in moderately good time. Here before seven: place in
utter darkness; found friendly policeman with bull's-eye light;
tightened my belt; cocked my pistol; requisitioned Bobby and his
lantern. You should have seen us groping our way into House;
Bobby first, with bull's-eye
lantern professionally flashing
to right and left, under
seats, into dark corners.
Made straight for my old
corner-seat below Gangway;
something white gleaming
on front bench; with supple
turn of wrist Bobby brought
flambeau to bear upon it;
found it was <span class="sc">Tanner</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tanner</span>,
hatless, coatless,
without even a waistcoat on!
You might have knocked me
down with much less than
bayonet-prod. 'Morning,
Colonel,' says he. 'Been
here all night?' I gasped.
'Oh, no,' says he; 'had cup
of coffee at stall by Westminster
Bridge, bought a
few hats in the New Cut,
and, you see, I've planted
them out.' So he had, by
Gad! Every corner-seat
taken, and he prone in <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther's</span>. 'Weren't enough o'
them,' <span class="sc">Tanner</span> said, with his sixpenny snigger; 'couldn't leave
put our revered leaders, <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> and <span class="sc">O'Brien</span>, you know. So
just took off my coat, flopped it down for <span class="sc">Tim</span>, hung the waist-coast
on a knob, and there's <span class="sc">William O'Brien's</span> place secured for
the night. Now, if you'd like a seat, you'll find one above the
Gangway; or if you want to come and sit by me, here you are. I've
got a necktie, a collar, and a pair of braces to spare; if you've any
particular friends in your mind, why, we'll get seats for them.'
No knowing what a fellow like <span class="sc">Tanner</span> would do in these circumstances.
Even his trowsers not sacred. So made best of bad job,
and here I am. At least, better off than <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span>, evicted
without compensation for disturbance."</p>

<p>Conversation interrupted by loud cheer. Mr. G. marching with
head erect, and swinging stride, to take the Oath and his seat.
Necessary by Standing Orders that two Members shall accompany
new Member on these occasions to certify identity and prevent guilty
impersonation. It's a wise child that knows his own father, but
<span class="sc">Herbert</span>, walking on one side of Premier, with <span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span> on
other, ready to testify. Clerk at table, thus assured all was right,
administered Oath and then conducted Premier up to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
presenting the new Member.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, I presume," said <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, making a motion
towards extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said the new Member, nervously.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, now shaking hands. "I've often
heard of you. I daresay you'll soon get accustomed to the place,
and will, I hope, be comfortable." Mr. G. bowed, and retired to his
seat. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> suffered succession of shocks as in same way were
brought up and introduced to him, <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, <span class="sc">John Morley</span>,
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>, the Count <span class="sc">Mundellani</span>, <span class="sc">George Trevelyan</span>,
The Boy <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, and quite a host of new acquaintances.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;New Members took their seats. Address moved.</p>

<p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;Something like flash of old times to-night.
Of course, it came from Irish quarter, and it was <span class="sc">Saunderson</span> who
kindled the torch. Colonel presented himself early in sitting on
corner bench below Gangway. This apparently reverted to possession
of <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span>. He lent it to Colonel for an hour, sitting
on other side of him. How they secured the place is a mystery,
darkened by temporary disappearance of <span class="sc">Tanner</span>. "Where is
<span class="sc">Tanner</span>?" Members ask, looking, not without suspicion, on placid
face and generally respectable appearance of <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span>. Last
seen, not exactly in company of <span class="sc">Jemmy</span> and the Colonel, rather in
conflict for the corner-seat. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> has the seat; lends it to
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span>. But where is <span class="sc">Tanner</span>?</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>he</i>'s all right," said <span class="sc">Lowther</span>, with forced smile, when
<span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span>, with ill-feigned indifference, inquired after the
lamb missing from his fold. "Bad sixpence, you know; always
turns up," <span class="sc">Jemmy</span> added. But his merriment forced, and <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>
abruptly changed subject.</p>

<p>Evidently a case for <span class="sc">Sherlock Holmes</span>; must place it in his
hands.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was with object of diverting attention from a ghastly
subject that <span class="sc">Saunderson</span> led up to row alluded to. In course of
remarks on release of Gweedore prisoners, he alluded to Father
<span class="sc">McFadden</span> as "a ruffian." Irish Members not used to language of
that kind. Howled in pained indignation; the Colonel, astonished
at his own moderation, varied the phrase by calling the respected
P.P. "a murderous ruffian." Shouts of horror from compatriots
closely massed behind. <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, in particular, boiling with indignation
at use of language of this character addressed to gentlemen
from whom one had
difference of opinion on
public matters. Nothing
would content them short of
absolute and immediate withdrawal.
Colonel declined to
withdraw. Uproar rose in
ungovernable fury. Every
time Colonel opened his
mouth to continue his remarks,
an Irish Member (so
to speak) jumped down his
throat.</p>

<p>Considerable proportion of
Ministerial majority had disappeared
in this fashion,
when happy thought occurred
to <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>. Hotly
moved that <span class="sc">Saunderson</span> "be
no longer heard." Considering
he had not been
heard for fully five minutes,
this joke excellent. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
however, wouldn't see it.
<span class="sc">Colonel</span> trumped the card
by moving Adjournment of Debate. Mr. G. interposed, adjured
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span> to put end to scene by withdrawing expression
objected to.</p>

<p>Colonel, hitherto obdurate, found irresistible the stately appeal
from Premier. "Certainly," said he, ever ready to oblige; "I will
withdraw the words 'murderous ruffian,' and substitute the expression,
excited politician." This accepted as perfectly satisfactory.
Terms apparently synonymous; but the latter, on the whole, less
irritating to susceptible nerves. Irish members round about
fell on Colonel's neck; embraced him with tears; gently disengaging
himself, he proceeded uninterrupted to the end of his
address.</p>

<p>"Capital title that," said <span class="sc">George Newnes</span>, who always has eye
to business. "Shall start a new Weekly; lead off with serial Novel
by Colonel <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, entitled <i>The Murderous Ruffian; or, the
Excited Politician</i>. Sure to take."</p>

<p>All very well, this cleverly conceived diversion. But where is
Dr. <span class="sc">Tanner</span>? <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Address.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Still harping on Ireland. Began with row round
issue of Writ for South Meath. <span class="sc">Esmonde</span>, one of innumerable Whips
present House possesses, says the business was his. "Then why
didn't you do it?" asked <span class="sc">Nolan</span>. "As you didn't seem disposed
to move, I do." Nationalists want to get North Meath Election
finished first; Parnellites don't. So <span class="sc">Esmonde</span> is in no hurry to
move Writ, and Colonel <span class="sc">Nolan</span> is. Pretty, in these circumstances
to hear <span class="sc">Nolan</span> with his indignant inquiry, "Is the moving of Writs
to be taken as an Election dodge?"</p>

<p>After Ireland, Uganda. <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span> talked for
hour and half. Later, rose to blandly explain that this was only
half his speech; rest will be delivered when he brings question up
again on Supplementary Vote. As Mr. G. says, this is fair notice,
and every Member may determine for himself whether he will
forego a portion of the promised treat. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Talking.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Everyone knows Mr. <span class="sc">Austin Dobson's</span> dainty verse. In <i>Eighteenth
Century Vignettes</i> (<span class="sc">Chatto and Windus</span>) everyone has an opportunity,
which he will do well to seize, to enjoy his equally charming prose.
Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson</span> is one of those enviable men who have time to
read. He spends an appreciable portion of his days and nights not
only with <span class="sc">Addison</span>, but with <span class="sc">Steele</span>, <span class="sc">Prior</span>, <span class="sc">Johnson</span>, <span class="sc">Goldsmith</span>,
and others, whom a generation that read newspapers and subscribe
to <span class="sc">Mudie's</span>, know only by name. Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson</span> is so omnivorous,
that he has read right through <span class="sc">Jonas Hanway's</span> <i>Journal of Eight
Days' Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston-upon-Thames</i>, the
book which drew from <span class="sc">Johnson</span> the genial remark that <span class="sc">Hanway</span>
"had acquired some reputation by travelling abroad, but lost it all
by travelling at home." A man that would read that, would read
anything. Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson</span>, happily, survived it, living to write a paper
in which, within the limit of a
few pages, we become thoroughly
acquainted with <span class="sc">Jonas</span>, his travels
in Persia, his discreet flirtations,
his umbrella (the first under which
man ever walked in the streets
of London), his suit of rich dark
brown, lined with ermine, his
<i>chapeau bras</i> with gold button, his
gold-hilted sword, and his three
pairs of stockings. <span class="sc">Jonas</span> always
thought there was safety in numbers,
whether odd or even. When
he travelled, his "Partie" consisted
of Mrs. D. and Mrs. O.
When he dedicated a book (which
Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson</span> found, more than a
hundred years later, in a second-hand
book-shop in Holborn), he
inscribed it to the "Twin Sisters,
Miss <span class="sc">Elizabeth</span> &amp; Miss <span class="sc">Caroline
Grigg</span>." When he took his
walks abroad, he wore three pairs
of stockings. <span class="sc">Jonas Hanway</span>,
under Mr. <span class="sc">Dobson's</span> care, is
unexpectedly delightful. With
the same magic touch he brings
upon the stage <span class="sc">Steele</span>, <span class="sc">Fielding</span>,
<span class="sc">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="sc">Gray</span>, <span class="sc">Hogarth's
Sigismunda</span>, and Dr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>,
who lives for us again in his
garret in Gough Square. These
<i>Vignettes</i> should be framed in the
private room of every man and
woman who loves books.</p>

<h2>THE INFANT'S GUIDE TO KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Concerning Cash</span>.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is cash?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Cash may be described as comfort in the concrete.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it not sometimes called "the root of all evil"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, by those who do not possess it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it possible to live without cash?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly&mdash;upon credit.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you tell me what is credit?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Credit is the motive power which induces persons who have
cash, to part with some of it to those who have it not.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you give me an instance of credit?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly. A young man who is able to live at the rate of
a thousand a-year, with an income not exceeding nothing a month,
is a case of credit.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Would it be right to describe
such a transaction "as much to
his credit"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It would be more precise
to say, "much by his credit;"
although the former phrase would
be accepted by a large class of the
community as absolutely accurate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is bimetallism?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Bimetallism is a subject
that is frequently discussed by
amateur financiers, after a good
dinner, on the near approach of
the coffee.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can you give me your impression
of the theory of bimetallism?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> My impression of bimetallism
is the advisability of obtaining
silver, if you cannot get gold.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the best way of
securing gold?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The safest way is to borrow
it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Can money be obtained in
any other way?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In the olden time it was
gathered on Hounslow Heath and
other deserted spots, by mounted
horsemen wearing masks and
carrying pistols.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the modern way of
securing funds, on the same principles,
but with smaller risk?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By promoting Companies
and other expedients known to
the members of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Foreign Clerks.</span>&mdash;I should be
grateful for any information as
to where I could acquire a knowledge
of French, German, Italian,
Spanish, Arabic, and Russian,
without leaving the neighbourhood
of Camberwell New Road,
and at a merely nominal cost. I
find that, unless I know those languages,
I have no chance of competing
with German Clerks; whereas, if I did know them, I should
be nearly sure of obtaining a berth in a London Firm at not less
than fifteen shillings a week, rising, by half centuries, to fifteen
and sixpence, and even to sixteen shillings. Also, what is the least
amount of porridge (without milk or sugar), haricot beans, or lentil
soup, that will preserve a person from starvation, if he takes
nothing else, and works fourteen hours a day? I intend imitating
my Teutonic rivals in frugality, as well as in languages; any
dietetic hints (especially from Scotchmen), would therefore be
welcomed by <span class="sc">No Polyglot</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Delicate Request.</span>&mdash;On Wednesday&mdash;that day in every week
which is kept as a whole holiday in honour of <i>Mr. Punch</i>&mdash;the
8th Feb., there is to be "a meeting of Old Paulines" at Anderton's
Hotel, when "<i>the attendance of all Old Paulines is requested</i>."
Ahem! The aged representatives of the heroine of the <i>Lady of
Lyons</i> will not be attracted by the wording of this rather un-paulite
announcement. Why was not the invitation extended to the old
<i>Claude Melnottes</i> as well? There must be a lot of them about.</p>
